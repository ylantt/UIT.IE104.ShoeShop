                While <b>there isn't a law requiring ecommerce stores to have a Return Policy,
                you may need one</b> if you wish to enforce your terms and parameters of returns and refunds.
                </p>
                <p>
                For example, in the state of New York, if a retailer does not provide a Return & Refund Policy, the retailer will be required to accept returns and give refunds for all merchandise returned within 30 days of purchase.
                If you wish to limit this in any way, you will need to create and post a Return Policy with your own custom terms

              There are <b>two main benefits</b> to having a Return Policy.
              </p>
              <p>
              First,<b> you will be able to control your return terms.</b> 
              If you don't post a Return Policy, some laws require you to provide a minimum timeframe to accept all returns.
              </p>
              <p>
              Secondly, <b>you will gain the confidence of potential customers and convert more sales.</b>
              Shoppers are far more likely to do business with companies that have and post a Return Policy.
